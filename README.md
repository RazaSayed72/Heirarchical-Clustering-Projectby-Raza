# Heirarchical-Clustering-Projectby-Raza
This project examines hierarchical clustering, an unsupervised learning method that creates a tree of clusters based on data similarity. Starting with individual points, it merges them into larger clusters, producing a dendrogram to visualize relationships. This technique is valuable for customer segmentation and data analysis
